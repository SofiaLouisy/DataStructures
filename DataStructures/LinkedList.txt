A linked list is a sequence of data structures,
which are connected together via links.

Each link contains a connection to another link.

A linked list is the second most-used data 
structure after array.

Since it contains a link to the next node, 
the size is dynamic

It starts at the beginning (Simple linked list) and steps forward

Double linked link steps (Steps forward and backward)

Circular linked list steps (last element has a link to first)
