Usage:
    Good if iterations is to be done 
    with all elements, if #elements is fixed

An array is a container which can hold 
a fix number of items of the same type.

Most data structures uses arrays 
to implement their algorithms

Advantages:
- Quick insertion
- Very fast access if index known

Disadvantages:
- Slow search (n)
- Slow deletion (?)
- Fixed size

Basic operations:
- Traverse (print all elements)
- Insertion (at given index)
- deletion (at given index)
- Search (index or value)
- Update (at given index)

Insert:
    Adding an element to the end (1). Inserting (n)

Remove:
    Removing an existing element,
    and re-organizing the element (n)

Search:
    Comparing each element with value (n)

Update:
    With known index (1)
