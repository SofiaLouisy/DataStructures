Usage:
    Good if data links together in an unconsistent
    matter.

Advantages:
- Models real-world situations

Disadvantages:
- Some algorithms are slow and complex

vertices = V = {a,b,c,d,e} Can be sepresented by array
edges = E = {ab,ac,bc,cd,de} Can be represented by 2D array
adjacency - if the vertices are connect by one edges
path - a sequence of edges

Basic operations:
- Add vertex
- Add edge
- display vertex

Search
    Depth first: Uses stack to remember to get 
    the next vertex to start a seach when dead 
    end i reached (sounds like a linked list 
    might be used to create graph)
    Complexity depends on complexity 
    (how many edges each has) (n-n²-n³)

    Breadth first: Uses queue to know where
    start next bredth search
