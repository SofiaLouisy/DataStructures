Usage:
    Good for easy access of ordered data

Advantages:
- Quick search
- Quick insertion
- Quick deletion

Disadvantages:
- Complex to implement

Binary tree: max 2 children. Left child must have
value less than parent, right child more than parent
we end up with ordered generation

Basic operations
- Insert
- Search (an element)
- Preorder/inorder/portorder Traversal (pass through nodes)

insertion
    Locate proper location (search from root).
    If data is less than key value, search for empty
    location in left subtree (then right)
    (no generations) If tree is linear (n)

search
    same strategy
