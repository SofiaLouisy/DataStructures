This project aims to describe the different data structures
* lists
* hash tables
* trees
* heaps
* graphs
* (arrays)

What will be described:
* Complexity of common operations (isrfn)
* Which critical operations that are benifitial for the different data structures
* Why the choice of data structures matters

The complexity will be described on a high level for conseptual understanding, and the level of complexity will be expressed using O-notation.

The project should also include
* Code examples for algorithms
